	<h1>HELLO!</h1>
	<h2> my name is allison schaffer.</h2>
	<p>I'm a graphic designer at DMK Restaurants.  I have a BFA in Acting from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities.  I've lived in Chicago since the fall of 2009 and have worked at DMK Restaurants for 4 years.</p>
	<p>I grew up in Madison, WI where I fell in love with big yards, fresh air, Shakespeare, and white, snowy winters.  I love to ski, especially out west (Lake Tahoe!), and I wish there were more hiking opportunities in Chicago.</p>
	<p>I'm a sucker for 80's movies, the Oscars, my kitten Dakota, all things fall, and holidays - especially 4th of July and Halloween. If I can decorate, dress up, or give it a theme, I'm IN. I love neutral palettes with pops of color, minimalism, and sleek design.</p>
